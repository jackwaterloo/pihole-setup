# pihole-setup

This repository is for files related to my [pi-hole setup tutorial](https://jackwaterloo.com/running-pihole-in-docker-block-ads-across-all-applications/).

### Pi-Hole Compose File

This file is needed to deploy the *pihole* stack from *portainer*. Copy and paste the contents of the **pihole-compose.yml** file into the *web editor* on the stack deployment page.
